1. Overdraft Facilities
An overdraft is the ideal way to manage your cash flow at competitive rates of interest at speed. It is linked to your current account and you can use as much as you need, up to your limit. You can also apply for and either increase or decrease your limit through Internet banking. The controls are in your hands.
• An overdraft is quick and easy to arrange
• The cash is available when you need it
• You only pay interest on what you use, not on the full amount of your set limit
• Sole proprietors can apply for an overdraft or increase their limits
